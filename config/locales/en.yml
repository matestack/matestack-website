# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide

    component_examples:
      slide_1:
        heading: "Implement UI components in pure Ruby"
        text_1: "Create Ruby classes within your Rails project and call matestack's core components through a Ruby DSL in order to craft your UIs."
        text_2: "The Ruby method \"div\" for example calls one of the static core components, responsible for rendering HTML tags. A component can take Strings, Integers, Symbols, Arrays or Hashes (...) as optional properties (e.g. \"title\") or require them (e.g. \"body\")."
      slide_2:
        heading: "Use your Ruby UI components on your existing Rails views"
        text_1: "Register your Ruby UI component classes with your desired DSL method and use the \"matestack_component\" helper in order to render your component within existing ERB views or Rails controllers."
        text_2: "The Ruby method \"card\" for example calls your \"Card\" class, enabling you to create a reuseable card components, abstracting UI complexity in your own components."
      slide_3:
        heading: "Use Ruby methods as partials"
        text_1: "Split your UI implementation into multiple small chunks helping others (and yourself) to better understand your implementation."
        text_2: "Using this approach helps you to create a clean, readable and maintainable codebase."
      slide_4:
        heading: "Use class inheritance"
        text_1: "Because it's just a Ruby class, you can use class inheritance in order to further improve the quality of your UI implementation."
        text_2: "Class inheritance can be used to easily create variants of UI components but still reuse parts of the implementation"
      slide_5:
        heading: "Use components within components"
        text_1: "Just like you used matestack's core components on your own UI component, you can use your own UI components within other custom UI components."
        text_2: "You decide when using a Ruby method partial should be replaced by another self contained UI component!"
      slide_6:
        heading: "Yield components into components"
        text_1: "Sometimes it's not enough to just pass simple data into a component. No worries! You can just yield a block into your components!"
        text_2: "Using this approach gives you more flexibility when using your UI components. Ofcourse yielding can be used alongside passing in simple params."
      slide_7:
        heading: "Use named slots for advanced content injection"
        text_1: "If you need to inject multiple blocks into your UI component, you can use \"slots\"!"
        text_2: "Slots help you to build complex UI components with multiple named content placeholders for highest implementation flexibility!"
    reactivity_examples:
      slide_1:
        heading: "Toggle parts of the UI based on events"
        text_1: "Matestack offers an event hub. Reactive components can emit and receive events through this event hub. \"onclick\" and \"toggle\" calling two of these reactive core components."
        text_2: "\"onclick\" emits an event which causes the body of the \"toggle\" component to be visible for 5 seconds in this example"
      slide_2:
        heading: "Call controller actions without JavaScript"
        text_1: "Core components offer basic dynamic behaviour and let you easily call controller actions and react to server responses on the client side without full page reload."
        text_2: "The \"action\" component is configured to emit an event after successfully performed an HTTP request against a Rails controller action, which is received by the \"toggle\" component, displaying the success message."
      slide_3:
        heading: "Dynamically handle form input without JavaScript"
        text_1: "Create dynamic forms for ActiveRecord Models (or plain objects) and display server side responses, like validation errors or success messages, without relying on a full page reload."
        text_2: "Events emitted by the \"form\" component can be used to toggle parts of the UI."
      slide_4:
        heading: "Implement asynchronous, event-based UI rerendering in pure Ruby"
        text_1: "Using matestack's built-in event system, you can rerender parts of the UI on client side events, such as form or action submissions. Even server side events pushed via ActionCable may be received!"
        text_2: "The \"async\" component requests a new version of its body at the server via an HTTP GET request after receiving the configured event. After successful server response, the DOM of the \"async\" component gets updated. Everything else stays untouched."
      slide_5:
        heading: "Manipulate parts of the UI via ActionCable"
        text_1: "\"async\" rerenders its whole body - but what about just appending the element to the list after successful form submission?"
        text_2: "The \"cable\" component can be configured to receive events and data pushed via ActionCable from the server side and just append/prepend new chunks of HTML (ideally rendered through a component) to the current \"cable\" component body. Updating and deleting is also supported!"
      slide_6:
        heading: "Easily extend with Vue.js"
        text_1: "Matestack's dynamic parts are built on Vue.js. If you want to implement custom dynamic behaviour, you can simply create your own Vue components and use them along matestacks core components."
        text_2: "It's even possible to interact with matestack's core components using the built-in event bus."
    spa_examples:
      slide_1:
        heading: "Create your layouts and views in pure Ruby"
        text_1: "The app class is used to define a layout, usually containing some kind of header, footer and navigation. The page class is used to define a view. Following the same principles as seen on components, you can use components (core or your own) in order to create the UI"
        text_2: "The \"transition\" component enables dynamic page transition, replacing the content within \"yield_page\" with new serverside rendered content."
      slide_2:
        heading: "Apps and pages are referenced in your Rails controllers and actions"
        text_1: "Instead of referencing Rails layouts and views on your controllers, you just use apps and pages as substitutes."
        text_2: "Work with controllers, actions and routing as you're used to! Controller hooks (e.g. devise's authenticate_user) would still work!"
      slide_3:
        heading: "Use CSS animations for fancy page transition animations"
        text_1: "Use matestack's css classes applied to the wrapping DOM structure of a page in order to add CSS animiations, whenever a page transition is performed."
        text_2: "You can even inject a loading state element, enriching your page transition effect."

UI code becomes a native and fun part of your Rails app. Thanks to reactive core components, reactivity can be optionally added on top without writing JavaScript, just using a simple Ruby DSL."

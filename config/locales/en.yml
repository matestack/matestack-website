# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    slide_1:
      heading: "Define your UI in Ruby classes"
      text_1: "Create Ruby classes within your Rails project and use methods like \"div\" to define your user interface."
      text_2: "The \"div\" method calls one of the static core components, responsible for rendering HTML tags."
    slide_2:
      heading: "Use partials for a clean structure"
      text_1: "Simple Ruby methods help you creating well structured UI code."
    slide_3:
      heading: "Create your own components"
      text_1: "Instead of using partials, you can move parts of your UI code to custom component classes. These can then be reused across different parts of your application and make for very DRY code."
    slide_4:
      heading: "Call controller actions without JavaScript"
      text_1: "Core components offer basic dynamic behaviour and let you easily call controller actions and react to server responses on the client side without full page reload."
    slide_5:
      heading: "Dynamically handle form input without JavaScript"
      text_1: "Create dynamic forms for ActiveRecord Models (or plain objects) and display server side responses, like validation errors or success messages, without relying on a full page reload."
    slide_6:
      heading: "Define asynchronous, event-based UI rerendering in pure Ruby"
      text_1: "Using matestack's built-in event system, you can rerender parts of the UI on client side events, such as form or action submissions."
      text_2: "This also works for server side events broadcasted via ActionCable!"
    slide_7:
      heading: "Easily extend with Vue.js"
      text_1: "Matestack's dynamic parts are built on Vue.js. If you want to implement custom dynamic behaviour, you can simply create your own Vue components and use them along matestacks core components."
      text_2: "It's even possible to interact with matestack's core components using the built-in event bus."
